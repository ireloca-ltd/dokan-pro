Currently 4 product types are supported eg. physical product, downloadable product, variable product and bookable products through the [Dokan WC Bookings](https://wedevs.com/products/plugins/dokan/woocommerce-booking-integration/) add on.

**Earn in many ways**

Profit doesn’t only rely on sales. Multiple ways allow earning through vendor commissions or product based commissions. You can also create subscription packs that allow you to charge for product uploads, product limits and time.
